You end up frustrated and start to feel alone. Like you’re facing all these battles inside your head and you can’t tell anyone because it seems like nobody cares? And even when they do care, they can’t do anything about it… </p><p class="">We have all had those days my friend and you’re not alone. Days where the purpose of life seems lost and non-existent, like there is no hope or future for you. Let’s be honest, there are things each one of us struggle with and we don’t always know what to do in that moment. We wish the world would swallow us up and we could just disappear. And in that moment, you have no words, you have no hope and for some odd reason you want to stay there, because you feel helpless, lost and alone… </p><p class="">In times like that all you need to hear is, “I love you”. </p><p class="">And don’t get me wrong, I’m not talking about love from a boyfriend/girlfriend or even any other person. I mean from your heavenly Father. The one who loves you more than your mind could ever comprehend, the one who gave his son so that he can have a close relationship with you. He chooses you… </p><p class="">“Why do I need to hear he loves me? I know he loves me.” My friend, sometimes we know in our heads, but we don’t believe it in our hearts. If God loves you, doesn’t that mean he has a plan and future for you? If he loves you, don’t you think he will heal you from the pain and hopelessness you might be feeling in that moment? YES, He will... why?? Because HE LOVES YOU… </p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">We tend to forget that when we go through something, the devil tries to keep our focus on the situation and not your position. And your position is a beloved child of God. That means ALL the promises of heaven are yours, because of Jesus. </p><p class="">After Jesus was baptised, God said: “This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.” Jesus then went into the wilderness for 40 days and nights. Then the devil came to tempt and distract him. The devil kept saying “If you are the son of God do this, if you are the son of God do this...” There is one world the devil kept leaving out, and that is the word, “beloved”. Why would he leave that out? I’ll let you think about that one, wink wink… </p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">My friend, today know that even though sometimes we feel like God isn’t answering all our questions or isn’t helping us with all our tasks or difficulties that He is always whispering to our hearts that He loves us and He’s got us in the palm of His hands. Stop for a moment amidst the rush and meditate on what His love for you and He will give you strength, peace and direction.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/png" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c/1615031660034-NDV1R0P7TEQN8ASR866H/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kJK4Mm1kch8SFO9ZNkN1NT97gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmN9YSRtfoTLg6dUq-6F17A0FFZK5fArcnK1IqGweyunyWChwIwkIJ_P7MaZif-uMs/BP+Graphic.png?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1080" height="1080"><media:title type="plain">All you need to hear…</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Surgery</title><dc:creator>Faith Grobler</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2021 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.redemptionchurch.co.za/youth-blogs/surgery</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c:5ff2d68b0493bd282766614e:602e4894604921247f5fc7dc</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">So it’s no new news that 2020 was a really difficult and confusing year. I probably won’t be the first person to tell you about how horrible the previous set of 365 days were (If you’re on Tik Tok, ye’ probably know lol). It sucked for a lot of us, didn’t it? I know people who lost close family members, some friends whose parents lost jobs, some acquaintances who went through extreme anxiety and panic, some peers who endured heavy disappointment and some family who just felt like giving up. Last year put loads and dump trucks of emotional and mental tax on us, and we found out that we weren’t as resilient as we thought we’d be. </p><p class="">If you’re anything like me, you were probably left asking yourself as well as others (and maybe even God) a few questions. I personally wondered what the point of last year was. It honestly didn’t make any sense. Why would a year whose digits paired perfectly be so full of chaos and disorder? Who’s going to be the next Black Panther? Why are so many people more cautious about the vaccine than they are about the virus itself? 2020 felt like a paradox. At one stage, I thought it to be entirely possible that heaven’s management team might have been servicing a black whole somewhere two galaxies away, left it open without finishing the job, and 2020 was the result of their work not being done properly. I know that sounds a bit on the far end, but last year was on the far end as well. It seemed perfectly sensible to me that last year’s chaos required a chaotic explanation. To be honest, the question that still bothers my mind is this: How do I reconcile the absolute reality that God is good with the uncomfortable fact that 2020 sucked? </p><p class="">Here’s my shot at it.</p><p class="">Think about this for a second; a serial killer and a surgeon might both regularly gut people’s stomachs open. When the murderer does it, it’s a bad thing. However, when the surgeon does so, the action is good. Why is it that a surgeon cutting someone’s abdomen open is good, but a horror movie type homicidal maniac doing it is wrong? At least one reason stands out to me: the serial killer does it for the purpose of causing harm; the surgeon does it for the purpose of good. It’s entirely possible that one action in a specific context can be bad, but that same action in another context can be beneficial. Here’s a sobering thought. Could it be possible that what unstable and malevolent human beings (and the devil too) intend for harm, God would intend for good? What if the disorder created by human beings in 2020, for the purpose of doing bad, God had allowed for the purpose of causing good?</p><p class="">I’m aware that might not answer some of your questions about personal experiences that occurred last year, but let’s try and play out a scenario quickly. Imagine that you were a four year old playing around in the hospital waiting area, and your curiosity led you to exploring the ER room. As you entered, you saw a team of adults with surgical masks cutting open someone’s body and causing blood to leak everywhere. As a toddler, that would probably be a confusing and scary experience for you, right?&nbsp; Why would grown-ups be gutting open another human being and causing him to bleed? The mind of a four year old, not yet having the experience to understand what was going on, would probably ask why these adults were causing harm and pain to another person. In REALITY, the team of surgeons would actually be doing a good thing. Your young mind would need another adult to explain to you what surgery was, and why they had to operate on that poor man’s body. &nbsp;I think that our perspectives on life, as compared to God’s infinite wisdom, are like that of four year olds. What seems to us like mayhem, bloodshed and suffering in the world, is to God surgery on a broken and needy earth. 2020 was like an operating or emergency room in a hospital, and we walked right into the heat of it. </p><p class="">There’s scriptural support for this too. When Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers and put into prison for doing the right thing, he probably also felt like his world was ending. However, when his brothers came to ask him (Joseph now being prince of Egypt) for food, and they realised that it was their baby brother whom they had bullied and humiliated, Joseph said these words to them – “As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today” (Genesis 50:20). </p><p class="">The cross could be explained like that too. What seems to us like a violent and gory death (crucifixion) is in reality the vehicle that God used to save the world from its sin. When Jesus’ world was ending, he was really saving our world from ending. </p><p class="">Keep that in mind as you step in 2021. As painful as it was, it was just surgery. Heck, it might still be. However, God’s still in control. His thoughts are much more calculative and complex than ours. We see our immediate circumstances; God sees the good that our present situations will lead to in the future and long run. </p><p class="">So as we learn to walk by faith and not our sight, as we embark on viewing things from an eternal perspective, try and remember Romans 8: 28 - “And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them” (NLT). </p><p class="">Trust the surgeon.

Maybe it’s for a few hours, a few days. Maybe it’s even been years. I don’t know if you’re struggling with an addiction, with anxiety, with depression, with your health; whatever it is. And you feel like God isn’t there in that situation. You find yourself asking questions like, “Why aren’t You helping me?”. You have this sense of hopelessness.</p><p class="">A few weeks back, I had a complete breakdown. I’ve been struggling with something for over two years and I’ve tried everything to make it work but nothing ever seemed to change. I felt like God had abandoned me; left me on my own to stumble along. And there, in the middle of my breakdown; when I felt like I couldn’t take it anymore, God spoke to me. “It was never your burden to carry”. I had been trying and trying to get through this relying on myself, my own abilities. We were never meant to carry the burden of our problems. We were never meant to handle everything on our own. God doesn’t want us to struggle. It’s not His heart. He says, “Come to Me all who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28). He wants us to come to Him and give Him our struggle and He will give us rest; He will give us Peace.</p><p class="">One verse that God gave me in that moment was Psalm 55:22 which says, “Cast your burdens on the Lord and He will sustain you; He will never let the righteous be shaken”. What stuck out for me was the word ‘cast’. In the dictionary, cast means to ‘throw or to fling’. You know that feeling when you’ve been carrying something heavy around and when you finally have the chance to put it down (or fling it away), you just feel lighter. When you cast your burdens on the Lord, we throw the heaviness off of our shoulders and onto His. We feel lighter. Another word that stuck out was ‘burden’. The word burden means ‘a load or something that leaves you distressed and worried’. In Greek, the word for burden is ‘phortion’ (pronounced Forsio), meaning ‘troubles of life’. That same word also describes “man’s load of imperfections”. So, not only can we throw our struggles on the Lord, but we can also throw our imperfections on Him. Any lack, any failure, we can give it all to Him and receive His rest, His peace, His lightness. ‘And He will sustain you’. That word sustain, in the dictionary, means that He will encourage you. He will strengthen you and comfort you.</p><p class="">Think about something that you’ve been struggling with; something that’s left you feeling burdened, feeling worried and cast it all on Him ‘for He cares for you’ (1 Peter 5:7).</p><p class="">-Abigail W</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c/1609762126603-1QBXAYMEPGC7CBAICBYS/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kFyD7pzB8zoMIVY5aiUuFlp7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0jG2lbcDYBOeMi4OFSYem8DMb5PTLoEDdB05UqhYu-xbnSznFxIRsaAU-3g5IaylIg/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1001"><media:title type="plain">It was never your burden to carry.</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Loin Belt</title><dc:creator>Faith Grobler</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 11:23:57 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.redemptionchurch.co.za/youth-blogs/loin-belt</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c:5ff2d68b0493bd282766614e:5ff2faa089898a72c7b04b68</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class=""><strong>Ephesians 6: 14 stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth having put on the breastplate of righteousness</strong>,</p><p class=""><br>Paul was in a Roman prison while he was writing the book of Ephesians. He was bound in chains while being guarded by Roman soldiers and the Holy Spirit started speaking to him through his surroundings. God often tries to speak to us through our circumstances. Even though it isn’t the most noticeable piece of armour the loin belt is mentioned first because of its importance. If a Roman soldier didn’t have their loin belt, they were in serious trouble on the battle field because it held all the other pieces of armour together. </p><p class="">The loin belt held the two pieces of the breast plate together, there was a latch for the sword and the shield for when it wasn’t being used, it also had a special pouch for the lance (throwing Spear). Without the Loin belt all the other pieces armour would fall apart. Likewise if we do not have our loin belt on ,we are left spiritually vulnerable to the attacks of the enemy.</p><p class=""> <strong>The Truth</strong> is the <strong>word of God</strong> the <strong>Bible</strong> , most of your spiritual armour is invisible but the Bible is so important it was manifested from the spiritual realm to our physical realm. It’s the only weapon that is visible to our sight and you are able to physically touch it. It needs to be central in our lives for us to be able to walk in God’s supernatural power. </p><p class="">God only needs a little bit of your time to do a super natural work in your life even a verse per day is enough of a gap for Him to do a super natural work in your life. Give him a little bit and he will multiply it. Not to say we become “unsaved” if you are not currently reading and applying the word to your life. After accepting Jesus as your saviour it is a done deal it's his blood that saves not your own but without the loin belt you will lose your sense of your righteousness in Christ, you will not experience His supernatural peace or joy and you will not be able to walk in faith toward God's promises for your life during tough times.</p><p class="">I remember going through a really difficult traumatic time last year and all I had was the word of God to really comfort me. Not to say I did not have support from my family and friends they were amazing, but I do believe that the word played a crucial role in empowering me to push through the difficulty I was experiencing. I read the amount that I could which was usually around one chapter a day sometimes less, it was difficult since I had a head injury.</p><p class="">John 8:32 And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. In 3 weeks I was set free from Post-Traumatic Stress and my mental functioning was fully restored,<br>I went back to competing the following month and even won a bronze medal at the 2019 Gauteng Powerlifting Championships after only being able to train for two weeks prior to the competition. The word of God will allow to walk through the difficult times you experience in life with His super natural power.</p><p class="">-Bandile</p><p class="">﻿</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c/1609762041670-A48CZ00NDM0EEE5RWCFF/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLkXF2pIyv_F2eUT9F60jBl7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0iyqMbMesKd95J-X4EagrgU9L3Sa3U8cogeb0tjXbfawd0urKshkc5MgdBeJmALQKw/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1000"><media:title type="plain">Loin Belt</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Real Talk</title><dc:creator>Faith Grobler</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 11:23:06 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.redemptionchurch.co.za/youth-blogs/real-talk</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c:5ff2d68b0493bd282766614e:5ff2fa6d232e037c66d3fcae</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">phesians 5:2 – And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma<br>NKJV</p><p class=""><br>In other words, live in Christ’s love.

What a fantastic day for a blog post. Mandela Day! Today we celebrate and honour the late icon who made such a vast impact. Today I want to discuss what sets icons apart and take a look at why we can have an even stronger standing and deep impact in this world IN JESUS.</p><p class=""><br>We hopefully all know a little bit about Madiba and that without him, and a few others, our nation would not be the same and our lives would be completely different in a negative way. They worked hard (to say the least) and put their lives at risk for decades so that one day our nation’s people would live in freedom and equality. Many people didn’t make it through the long walk to freedom but because of each of their sacrifice, we are able to be the Rainbow Nation that others dreamed of having.</p><p class=""><br>In honour of the sacrifices others made for our freedom, we are encouraged at this time of year to spend 67 minutes making a difference in our communities and serving others. This is a great initiative and we should all take the time to think of those other than ourselves and see ho we can serve practically in our areas.<br>That being said, 67 minutes out of an entire year sadly cannot change the world for maybe a few days. The goodness we do for others in this time may help others temporarily, but Jesus wants us to live a life that is constantly impacting others AND with long lasting effect. </p><p class="">When we focus on our relationship with our Father in Heaven and spend time in His presence to be loved by Him we will be guided by His peace and Holy Spirit to make an impact so large that whole communities and cities will be changed and filled with the life of God! We all want to see positive change in the world around us and to be a part of making those changes.</p><p class=""><br>When we look to Jesus that is a guarantee! You cannot spend time with God, be filled with His love and goodness, see His heart for others and not make an impact in the world around you! God is an impact making, miracle working God and all He needs from you is your attention. You don’t have to scheme of ways to jam yourself into community and force yourself to be a better person. When you simply spend time with Jesus; love, goodness and inspiration will flood into your heart! Loving others and making a difference in their world will come naturally and the Holy Spirit will guide you.<br>Jesus said in John 14:12, “I tell you the truth, anyone who believes in me will do the same works I have done, and even greater works, because I am going to be with the Father.”</p><p class=""><br>So, Jesus is saying that when we believe in Him, we will be part of even greater miracles and impact than He was. Think about that… that is crazy! Jesus on Earth was limited because He was only one man, but because He now lives in you and me, He is unlimited!<br>I want to encourage you today that if you want to see the world change and you want to make a lasting impact, let Jesus love upon you and change you first.</p><p class=""> Jesus has so much for you and such amazing plans for your life. Plans that are not just cool for you but are also going to change the lives of others! Just start with the basics. Ask God where to start, what to read, what worship song to listen to and let Him be your foundation, your rock, and your centre. Then everything that He builds on top of that will be strong, steady and light to those around you and beyond.  </p><p class="">-Ps.

In the Bible, we read that Paul pleads with God to remove the thorn in his side (2 Corinthians 12:7-10) and although we don’t know what exactly the thorn was in Paul’s side we know that God reminds him that His grace is sufficient.&nbsp;</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">During this period of uncertainty, the devil will try and attack your mental health by allowing feelings of despair, anxiety and even suicide to creep into your mind and although most of us can shake this feeling off or go and talk to someone about it, there are a few of us who struggle a little bit more. I struggle a lot with depression and anxiety, it’s a constant battle that is being fought in my mind, from things like being accepted as a person, as a leader or a member of the team to you finding yourself questioning “am I good enough?”, “Will people still like me if I say no?” etc. even making friends and maintain those relationships require more work and effort as you are constantly second-guessing yourself.&nbsp;</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">If you can identify with the above or you know you have asked yourself the same questions or been in similar situations know that the Bible has someone wonderful truths that will encourage you and bring you peace.&nbsp;</p><p class="">    </p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>YOU ARE NOT ALONE</strong></p></li></ol><p class="">    </p><p class="">Many of God’s people, even Jesus suffered mentally, emotionally and sometimes even physically. Even Jesus the Son of God cried out “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Matthew 27:46) but know that even in your suffering you are not alone.&nbsp;</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">There are many people who have journeyed where you are journeying, and speaking about what you are going through will allow people to be there for you, to pray for you and to support you in what you are going through.&nbsp;</p><p class="">    </p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>GOD SEES YOU AND HE IS WITH YOU&nbsp;</strong></p></li></ol><p class="">    </p><p class="">Our God is a God who experiences emotions with you when you are experiencing anxiety, doubt or fear remember that closeness of God and take rest that He is with you and will comfort you and give you peace, “Come to me all who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest”&nbsp; (Matthew 11:28) Jesus weeps with you as he wept with Lazarus’ family (John 11:35).

He knows every part of you. He knows what you’re facing right now, and what you’ve faced. I find it so funny that God knows everything about us, yet we try and hide ourselves from Him. He knows our failures, our weaknesses, and He still loves us. There’s no mistake too big, no secret too dark, to ever separate you from His love (Romans 8:39).  </p><p class="">    </p><p class="">Nothing can stop Him from loving us. He wants to pour out His love over every part of our lives, the good and the bad. He wants to give us all our heart’s desires, the desires He’s put there, and bless us out of our socks. We just need to open up ourselves to Him, nothing hidden, and receive all He has for us. And I know, it’s going to feel weird. Or hey, even scary. It always is when you’re vulnerable.</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">But what does being vulnerable with God actually look like? My friend once told me that she had a “date with her Daddy”. She sat outside on a blanket, and just had a conversation with God. Now, I’m not going to lie to you… the whole “date with your Daddy” thing seemed pretty odd to me, and I didn’t see myself really doing it. I felt like it was going to be awkward. Until one night, I couldn’t sleep. I really don’t know why, but I just couldn’t. </p><p class="">    </p><p class="">So, I decided, “Okay, instead of scrolling through Instagram, I’m going to pray”. Here I was, sitting in the dark ready to have a “date with my Daddy”. And you know when you’re just there, and you have no idea what to say… That was me. And I literally told Him that, I was like, “God, I really don’t know what to say now”. So, I just started talking to God about how life was going, you know, how’s school and family, everything. All of a sudden, before I knew it, I was pouring my heart out to Him. Telling Him everything that I was feeling, talking about my past, and even how uncertain I was about my future. You know that feeling you get when you have a really good cry, when you get it all out, and you feel lighter. </p><p class="">    </p><p class="">That feeling is 100 times better with God. And what I find so amazing is that, God knows what I need to get out of my system. He knows my struggles. He knows what I’m thinking and how I’m feeling, but He still listens. He always listens, and He doesn’t just leave me in my problems. He comes down to my level. He meets me right there where I am, in my brokenness, in my failures, and He tells me that everything’s going to be okay (Roman’s 8:28).</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">I want to leave you with a song. It’s one of my favorite right now. It’s called Known by Tauren Wells. As you read the lyrics (or listen to the lyrics, there’s a link below), open your heart up to Him, and let His love just wash over you, nothing hidden, nothing held back♥️</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">Known<br>Tauren Wells</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">It’s so unusual, it’s frightening<br>You see right through the mess inside me<br>And You call me out to pull me in<br>You tell me I can start again<br>And I don’t need to keep on hiding</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">I’m fully known, and loved by You<br>You won’t let go, no matter what I do<br>And it’s not one or the other, it’s hard truth and ridiculous grace<br>To be known, fully known<br>And loved by You<br>I’m fully known, and loved by You</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">It’s so like You to keep pursuing<br>It’s so like me to go astray<br>But You guard my heart with your truth<br>A kind of love that’s bulletproof<br>And I surrender to Your kindness</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">How real, how wide, how rich, how high is Your heart?<br>I cannot find the reasons why you give me so much</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">It’s so unusual, it’s frightening<br>I’M FULLY KNOWN, AND LOVED BY YOU</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">https://youtu.be/xckDgX8xNfg</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">With Love </p><p class="">Abigail</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c/1609761533695-ERQ9LPANRFDVCQY8B8WL/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kDHPSfPanjkWqhH6pl6g5ph7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0mwONMR1ELp49Lyc52iWr5dNb1QJw9casjKdtTg1_-y4jz4ptJBmI9gQmbjSQnNGng/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1125"><media:title type="plain">I’m Fully Known</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Heritage Day</title><dc:creator>Faith Grobler</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 11:14:59 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.redemptionchurch.co.za/youth-blogs/heritage-day</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c:5ff2d68b0493bd282766614e:5ff2f89218d44937a927b114</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">What an exciting day we get to celebrate here in South Africa! The Rainbow Nation. A unique and exciting blend of cultures and peoples from all walks of life. Naturally, with the way humans operate, there have sadly been some negatives in our past due to this blend and the lack of unity and revelation to how special diversity is. As you read this I hope you are inspired to see that whatever your background is and wherever you come from, you have a unique opportunity to make a difference and add to the world in a way no one else can.</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">Our differences and individual heritage are not actually something that we should see as limiting or shameful. Some spices or ingredients do not taste great on their own, but when they come together they make for a flavourful and tasty dish. It is the same with people if you’ll let God open your eyes to the wonder that is being different. We all have qualities we wish we had or things in our lives that we wish we didn’t have. God made you the way you are because He knows that you bring a flavour and greatness to the dish of life that no one else can.&nbsp;</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">If we were all the same, if we were all the same ingredient and all had the same exact flavour: life would be monotonous, boring and grey. Maybe we do not agree with everyones’ cultures, worldviews and ways of doing things but it is exactly this blend that brings a spice and excitement to life. </p><p class="">    </p><p class="">Of course it can be annoying that people do things in a different way or see things differently to the way you do, but discomfort is part of life and is how you grow. You could grow up with someone who lives in the same neighbourhood as you and even goes to the same school as you but they do things differently to you because of how they were raised and God will use them! He’ll use them and He’ll use you in different ways because your situation is unique and you are unique.&nbsp;</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">Another way you could see how our different heritages come together for good is the human body. And to illustrate this I am going to use The Word of God to teach us. Look at these verses in 1 Corinthians 12:15-19 (NLT),</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">&nbsp;“15 If the foot says, “I am not a part of the body because I am not a hand,” that does not make it any less a part of the body. 16 And if the ear says, “I am not part of the body because I am not an eye,” would that make it any less a part of the body? 17 If the whole body were an eye, how would you hear? Or if your whole body were an ear, how would you smell anything?<br>18 But our bodies have many parts, and God has put each part just where he wants it. 19 How strange a body would be if it had only one part!”</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">Here we see God make it so clear to us. We all have separate functions and play a crucial part in the body of Christ. Our uniqueness adds to the whole. No matter what you circumstance is, what you think your limitations are or your family history, never forget that God can and will use everything about you for His Glory and to make an impact on this world beyond your wildest dreams. </p><p class="">    </p><p class="">At the end of the day you are not merely a citizen of the country that you are in, but you are a Child of God (Romans 8:15-16), a Citizen of Heaven (Philippians 3:20) and a Co-heir with Christ who is seated in heavenly places (Romans 8:17). Simply seek Jesus and He will lead you into where your heritage adds to His story. </p><p class=""> - Ps. Matt</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c/1609761316007-MHFFBF953OY9CWKWHS7F/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kOeC2_vIwtkNO4KLfB1JIsJ7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UedT6MCuDrG0_6iPwXLGF1669zXNhvZ0Gt3DqtjtSHkNlcTmcwU-Ed_fLjLxuPb0KQ/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1875"><media:title type="plain">Heritage Day</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Speak life-giving words.</title><dc:creator>Faith Grobler</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 11:12:40 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.redemptionchurch.co.za/youth-blogs/speak-life-giving-words</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c:5ff2d68b0493bd282766614e:5ff2f802634c4829a8de767d</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">Proverbs 16:24 TPT ~ Nothing is more appealing than speaking beautiful, life-giving words. For they release sweetness to our souls and inner healing to our spirits.</p><p class="">‘Speak life’ has been sort of an anthem at our church, and for good reason! As sons and daughters of our beloved Abba, we have been given a voice that resonates with authority and power. Our voice is a gift and if used correctly, it can be used to echo the love of Jesus to all who will hear. It is also a weapon that we have been blessed with to enable us to overcome battles that we will face in our lifetime, be it a diagnosis, financial crisis, anxiety, a broken home…. The ability to be able to call upon our Abba for counsel and comfort is reassuring. It allows us to lift Him up when we don’t even know how to do that for ourselves.</p><p class="">I had a dream the other night, where my family, a friend and I were at an airport and we were about to board plane. At the entrance, they were testing everyone’s temperature to see if they had the coronavirus. My mum and siblings were let through, but suddenly my friend and I were stopped because we were shown to have high temperatures. Disappointed and annoyed that I was about to miss the trip of a lifetime because of a high temperature, the Holy Spirit urged me to instantly speak life over myself. I faced the security guard and said with authority and affirmation, “By Jesus’ stripes, I am healed! And by His stripes, my friend is healed too! Now test us again!”. And with that, we were tested again and this time we displayed no symptom of the virus and were let through the gate. I woke up with such a smile on my face because I knew that this was God telling me what power we have with our words. We have the ability to speak healing not only over ourselves, but over our loved ones too!</p><p class="">So many times, we forget that what we face in reality is not set in stone. We have a voice within us that is fuelled by the Holy Spirit which has the power to shift a situation around in our favour. There is power when we speak (call upon) the name of Jesus. There is power when we allow the Holy Spirit to intercede for us. There is power in reading the Word of God aloud and wrapping ourselves in His warm embrace. There is power in declaring victory and blessings over our situation and reiterating our Abba’s good thoughts that He has towards us as His beloved sons and daughters.</p><p class="">We have a voice that resonates so don’t be shy to use it. Use this wonderful gift that God has given us to speak healing over ourselves and loved ones, speak encouragement, speak forgiveness, speak truth, speak love, speak victory and speak JESUS!</p><p class="">Speak life-giving words!</p><p class="">~ Jaydeen Govender</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class=""><a href="https://redemptionyouth.squarespace.com/blogs/the-greatest-advice-to-live-your-best-life"><br></a></p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c/1609761245935-5JPVIS5P2EA9BCTSKQP4/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kFyD7pzB8zoMIVY5aiUuFlp7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0jG2lbcDYBOeMi4OFSYem8DMb5PTLoEDdB05UqhYu-xbnSznFxIRsaAU-3g5IaylIg/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1001"><media:title type="plain">Speak life-giving words.</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>The greatest advice to live your best life.</title><dc:creator>Faith Grobler</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 11:11:55 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.redemptionchurch.co.za/youth-blogs/the-greatest-advice-to-live-your-best-life</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c:5ff2d68b0493bd282766614e:5ff2f7c546517e2c74e85fb7</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">If I was a thousand years old, full of so much wisdom and knowledge and you asked me for advice to live your best life I would tell you…</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">To grow your knowledge of our Heavenly Father: God</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">When we think of God, we usually associate Him as a judge, condemning, punishing and striking us with lightning because we disobey Him. Even us believers who have better knowledge of Him think of things along these lines. But thoughts like this are built from the wrong understanding of God.</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">In 2 Peter 1: 2 it says, “May God give you more and more grace and peace as you grow in your knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord.” More and more Grace and Peace, not more and more condemnation or religiousness. Learning about God with the revelation of Jesus Christ – that Christ died and rose for us so that we can be reconciled back to God and have a relationship with Him not based on our efforts but based on what Jesus did on the Cross for us – we experience His unfailing love and grace and see Him as a loving father full of compassion for us.</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">God is love (1 John 4: 18) , when we experience his perfect love we are made complete with the fullness of life and the power that comes from Him (Ephesians 3:19), He is faithful even when we are faithless (2 Timothy 2:13) He is the same yesterday, today and forever (Hebrews 13:8) and we can come to Him with bold confidence because God is greater than our feelings (1 John 3: 20)</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">We increase our knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord by reading the Word and praying that the Holy Spirit reveals more to us. When we know that we are loved and favoured by the Most High we find joy, peace, love, compassion, freedom etc all in Him. We learn to let go and put our trust in Him because He causes all things to work for our good (Romans 8:28).</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">God is good all the time and I pray you really understand that. Our Heavenly Father loves you unconditionally! He wants you to be happy, enjoying life, living in peace and abundance.</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">So if you asked me today what advice I would give you to live your best life, I would tell to grow in your knowledge of our faithful, compassionate Abba (Hebrew for dad). </p><p class="">be blessed, </p><p class="">Aza</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c/1609761161091-GGYDIK0JUQI7Q01O6T4J/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kN4TMBbmkAP1j5P2FsA4TT57gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0s2R59z2HWVKMNU9GXmUK4W3xnGoWQ_Tbg1aVTaEh-9rKTDNmv4Xy4y_V9iTQ8HrCA/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="919"><media:title type="plain">The greatest advice to live your best life.</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>The battle is not yours.</title><dc:creator>Faith Grobler</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 11:10:55 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.redemptionchurch.co.za/youth-blogs/the-battle-is-not-yours</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c:5ff2d68b0493bd282766614e:5ff2f78cb6dc0c1e6101647b</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">Lockdown has been a tremendously challenging time for most of us, personally leaving me to overthink just about everything. All the overthinking left me in a very dark&nbsp;mindset,&nbsp;and I began to feel as if everything in my life was uncontrollably going wrong. I was fearful and disheartened until one day being the “Gen Z” child I am, I was on&nbsp;TikTok. I came across this lady by the name of Hillary Caitlyn who was speaking about a verse from Chronicles, it was exactly what I needed to hear and I’m hoping this verse is what somebody else needs to hear too. So here we go…&nbsp;</p><p class="">In&nbsp;2&nbsp;Chronicles 20:15, God speaks to Jehoshaphat and tells him “Do not be afraid or discouraged… For the battle is not yours, but God’s”.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Jehoshaphat’s devotion to the Lord granted him safety against a coming war, and God can do the same thing for you.&nbsp;</p><p class="">No matter the struggle or tough situation you’re facing, God is always with you. This doesn’t mean we can take our hands off the wheel and hope that God will do all the steering – Jehoshaphat and his men still had to go to the battlefield but they had to trust that the Lord would keep them safe. In other words, our faith can be an incredibly powerful shield when hard times come our way. If we stay close to God, if we truly believe, He can help us through ANYTHING.&nbsp;</p><p class="">You may face tough times… when you feel like you are always fighting (fighting against loss or fear or any other battle). You might have weeks when you feel like the battle for joy just isn’t going your way. Let God fight for you. He fights the enemies of darkness. He fights for our love and our souls, ultimately sacrificing&nbsp;His Son for us because&nbsp;He loves us so much (John 3:16, “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life”).&nbsp;</p><p class="">Next time you feel like you’re facing a war you can’t win, turn to God just like Jehoshaphat did. The Lord may not take away our problems or our enemies overnight, but He will always give you the strength to overcome the mountains that the devil tries to put in our way.&nbsp; </p><p class="">Much blessings, </p><p class="">Leah-Joy</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c/1609761075465-U37W9FZYA5YENV2MXFZD/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLkXF2pIyv_F2eUT9F60jBl7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0iyqMbMesKd95J-X4EagrgU9L3Sa3U8cogeb0tjXbfawd0urKshkc5MgdBeJmALQKw/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1000"><media:title type="plain">The battle is not yours.</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>let’s talk about Halloween</title><dc:creator>Faith Grobler</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 11:09:58 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.redemptionchurch.co.za/youth-blogs/lets-talk-about-halloween</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c:5ff2d68b0493bd282766614e:5ff2f75810ee9f5922b8ad01</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">I must say that this has been a topic which I have wrestled with. How do you talk about a beloved (strangely so) ‘holiday’ without getting on everyone’s sensitive side? ‘Halloween is harmless’ and ‘Christians are just buzz kill.’ Well, let’s have a moment to be mature and see what God would want to say about the situation.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">At the end of the day, this is not about speaking out against and destroying Halloween. It’s about opening your eyes and growing your perspective and not just letting social constructs and media lead you along a path because it’s trendy and widely accepted. So, without further rambling, let’s get into it!</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">Halloween is fascinating. It is not the only celebration of its kind. It is a blend of Western media (movies and folk stories) and ‘ancient’ traditions still practised and celebrated today by different cultures around the world. Essentially Halloween is not much different from celebration days such as Dia De Los Mourtes (the Mexican celebration meaning, The Day of the Dead) and other pagan traditions which celebrate the dead. On these days death and horror are the main themes. Trick or Treating and house parties may be some of the more Western activities and maybe we don’t all fixate on the dead, but this is what these days are actually about.  </p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">Now, for most cultures that have these celebrations it is done with a level of good intention and to honour those who are no longer with us. I understand the intentions but to focus on those, repeatedly, who are no longer around is pointless. We throw lavish celebrations and spend money on days which desensitise us to the reality and seriousness of death and violence. We dedicate whole months to being ‘Spooktober’ in the lead up to a day which, historically, is actually a pretty messed up and evil day.  </p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">I’m all for having fun. One of my dreams is to have a full-on Storm Trooper outfit (Star Wars nerd alert). But when are we being THIS intentional in celebrating life and creation? Sure we have our birthdays but even then we like keeping it low key because no one these days likes being celebrated (maybe except a few people who tell you it’s their birthday on their IG story). If we had to put aside a day where we marvelled at life on Earth, protected one another, spoke life into everything and declared God’s goodness over everyone we saw and hung up Suns and ‘good vibes’ all over our houses, people would think that was weird. We feel far more comfortable hopping on the bandwagon and dressing up like serial killers, playboy bunnies and horror film characters than representing life on Earth and bringing the LIFE of GOD into everyday life.  </p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">This is not about making anyone feel condemned, this is about challenging the status quo. What are you getting too comfortable with? Are we just going to accept death, sickness and violence as a reality and something we celebrate? Or are we going to CHOOSE LIFE? Look at what God says in the Word:</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">Deuteronomy 30:19 (NLT)</p><p class="">19 “Today I have given you the choice between life and death, between blessings and curses. Now I call on heaven and earth to witness the choice you make. Oh, that you would choose life, so that you and your descendants might live!</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">Hint, hint. Nudge, nudge. God wants us to enjoy the fruitfulness and life that His presence, Word and Spirit bring! God does not want us to be desensitised to death and accept it. He wants us to be OBSESSED with the Life that Jesus brings.  </p><p class="">Halloween may come once a year but it represents something in our modern culture that we keep accepting and letting fear creep its way into our lives.  </p><p class="">At the end of the day, you need to follow the Peace of God. If you feel the greenlight to celebrate Halloween and join the festivity, you do you. If you feel the red light in your spirit and think something aint right, stop. Be awake and ask God what He would want you to do. His opinion and guidance is the only one that matters at the end of the day!</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">Be Blessed yall. </p><p class="">Pator Matt</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c/1609761000809-PU49F0I0SVVNFX8OCUFV/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLkXF2pIyv_F2eUT9F60jBl7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0iyqMbMesKd95J-X4EagrgU9L3Sa3U8cogeb0tjXbfawd0urKshkc5MgdBeJmALQKw/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1000"><media:title type="plain">let’s talk about Halloween</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>From Exam stress to Supernatural Rest.</title><dc:creator>Faith Grobler</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 11:08:56 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.redemptionchurch.co.za/youth-blogs/from-exam-stress-to-supernatural-rest</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c:5ff2d68b0493bd282766614e:5ff2f71eac5ecf06b66ac2bc</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">Everything is quiet,&nbsp;except&nbsp;for the occasional pen clicking. I can feel the tension in the examination Hall. I have studied for two weeks and I still feel like I know nothing. The teachers eventually hand out the exam papers and I stare at the cover page. My heart rate&nbsp;rises,&nbsp;and I have a huge knot in my stomach. “All I want to do is pass. All I want to do is pass.”, I said to myself.&nbsp; Fear creeps in... What if I fail? What if my parents disown me because of my mark? What if people mock me? What if… What if… what if….&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">Have you been in this situation recently? Have you ever studied for a week or two and go blank in the test? Or even avoid&nbsp;studying,&nbsp;because&nbsp;your anxiety level is too high? Exams&nbsp;can be a stressful time, but it&nbsp;doesn’t&nbsp;have to be. We get wrapped up in school so&nbsp;much because&nbsp;we are there&nbsp;almost&nbsp;24/7. We think that our whole future is wrapped up in THIS TEST. We put our future in the test, and we feel like a failure when we do badly in&nbsp;a test, we feel like we have no future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">My friends,&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;put your trust in a test. As soon as you put all your trust in your test you get stressed and you place pressure on yourself that is not needed. Place your trust somewhere that&nbsp;it&nbsp;is impossible to fail. Put your trust in God and&nbsp;His plan and purpose for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">I’m&nbsp;not saying don’t study and don’t write&nbsp;the&nbsp;exam.&nbsp;I’m&nbsp;saying trust God with your future&nbsp;AND your&nbsp;exam. Pray before you study and say,” God,&nbsp;thank you for your peace,&nbsp;I place my exam and my future in your hands.” This gives God an opportunity to help you during your exam. You&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;have to be anxious&nbsp;about studying or writing&nbsp;exams. God has a peace&nbsp;that&nbsp;He&nbsp;has given&nbsp;to&nbsp;you.&nbsp;Receive it from&nbsp;Him for&nbsp;He wants the best for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">I remember a friend who always wrote on his exam:” Jesus,&nbsp;this&nbsp;paper is in your hands.” That&nbsp;doesn’t&nbsp;mean he stopped writing and waited for Jesus to write the exam for him. Jesus just helped him by giving him peace and sharpening his memory. Jesus&nbsp;doesn’t&nbsp;spoon-feed&nbsp;us;&nbsp;He&nbsp;empowers&nbsp;us. God can use anything for your good.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when you think the&nbsp;information&nbsp;you’re&nbsp;learning&nbsp;isn’t&nbsp;relevant in life,&nbsp;God&nbsp;can always use it to help you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">When studying for a test, pray&nbsp;beforehand&nbsp;and ask God to be with you while you study.&nbsp;You’ll&nbsp;be surprised how studying can get a whole lot easier when you trust God. Keep in mind that not everyone studies the same way. My one friend had to study at least 2 weeks before, where I usually studied max 4 days before an exam, because if I studied two weeks before I would already forget the information by the time the exam came. Everyone studies different but believe me praying and trusting God helps a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">I want to leave you with a few scriptures that might just help you in your test season:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">“Trust in the Lord your God and lean not on your own understanding; In all your ways acknowledge Him.” – Proverbs 3:5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">“Peace I leave with you,&nbsp;My&nbsp;peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.” -John 14:27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">“For I know the thought I think toward you, says the Lord, thought of peace and not evil, to give you a future&nbsp;and a hope.” -Jeremiah 29:11&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">Lots of love&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">-Annie&nbsp;</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c/1609760871274-TJZHUSP3143URSVPB2A1/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLkXF2pIyv_F2eUT9F60jBl7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0iyqMbMesKd95J-X4EagrgU9L3Sa3U8cogeb0tjXbfawd0urKshkc5MgdBeJmALQKw/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1000"><media:title type="plain">From Exam stress to Supernatural Rest.</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Self-Love in Christ</title><dc:creator>Faith Grobler</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2019 17:15:07 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.redemptionchurch.co.za/youth-blogs/blog-post-title-one-4y6y5</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c:5ff2d68b0493bd282766614e:5ff2d68b0493bd282766614f</guid><description><![CDATA[We live in a world that is obsessed with perfection.

There are so many standards that we feel the need to live up to and when we don’t meet these standards we feel as if we are not good enough. The truth is, our constant pursuit of perfection stems from our need to be loved.</p><p class="">    Because of our need to be loved, we run to different things hoping to feel loved, but we don’t know what unconditional love truly is. This is why we try to fill our void with clout or materialistic things where we really just end up feeding our ego which only offers a temporary feeling of satisfaction/contentment. Or we run to relationships whether it be romantic relationships or platonic relationships (friendships, family members, etc), where we end up expecting people to love us in a way that only God can love us. In all honesty, the things we run to, from the likes on Instagram to that one guy/girl texting you back, might make you feel good for a moment and it might be what you want, but it is not necessarily what you need.</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">When I first heard about self-love, I tried to love myself without God. I found myself in a constant cycle, where one day I would love myself and the next I felt like there was no way that I could ever be loved. Human nature only knows how to love conditionally. When we try to love ourselves without God, our love is conditioned to our perception of ourselves in a specific season or moment of our lives. Our perception of ourselves is always changing, and every time it changes we have to learn to love ourselves all over again.</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">Self-love without God can be draining and futile. Self-love with God is peaceful, refreshing and full of happiness.</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">Self-love with God goes beyond just tolerating your flaws or who you are as a whole, it means total acceptance and appreciation of who God has made you to be. 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 defines unconditional love. Loving yourself means being patient with yourself, being kind to yourself, not envying others or boasting or being prideful. It means honouring God, yourself, and others, being humble and slow to anger with yourself. It means keeping no receipts of your wrong doings and being honest with yourself. </p><p class="">    </p><p class="">It means protecting yourself through God’s wisdom and discernment to stay away from things that are only meant to bring you down. It means trusting yourself because God lives in you (1 John 4:13). It means being hopeful and persevering especially in the moments where love feels difficult and tough times are lasting. Basically, loving yourself unconditionally means doing or expressing all of the things the bible says love is to yourself. All of these things are who God is, which is why it is impossible for us to love unconditionally without God.</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">The only way to love yourself unconditionally is to open up your heart and let God (who lives in you) love you because loving yourself and loving others unconditionally is something that we can’t do in our own strength. You have to step away from the pursuit of perfection and the world’s standards and lean into God. Leaning into God can be difficult sometimes because it challenges our flesh but leaning into God is a decision we have to make and the best decision to make because it means choosing life (Deuteronomy 30:19-20). Leaning into God means putting in the effort to grow your relationship with him, spending time with him and praying, reading the bible, and overall choosing life and choosing him.</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">There might be challenges. Leaning into God can sometimes be uncomfortable because it requires you to step out of your comfort zone or let go of things, habits and sometimes even people that are hard to let go of BUT every challenge against your flesh paves the way for a new blessing to enter your life that is worth so much more than what you may have lost.</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">If you are reading this, God wants you to know that you are loved. He wants only the best for you, and he wants you to love who you are in him!</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">More life,<br>Reagile</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c/1609760771800-D70B4OFHFC4TKEOYHZC9/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLkXF2pIyv_F2eUT9F60jBl7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0iyqMbMesKd95J-X4EagrgU9L3Sa3U8cogeb0tjXbfawd0urKshkc5MgdBeJmALQKw/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1000"><media:title type="plain">Self-Love in Christ</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Who do you say I am?</title><dc:creator>Faith Grobler</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2019 17:07:41 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.redemptionchurch.co.za/youth-blogs/blog-post-title-two-srxrl</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c:5ff2d68b0493bd282766614e:5ff2d68b0493bd2827666151</guid><description><![CDATA[It all started on the 6th of August, 1999…]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">If you’re reading this at the moment, I’m going to give you a heads up, by telling you that the information you obtain in these next few minutes will probably be the most important thing you will learn in your entire life. No cap! I am being one hundred percent real. This is something that has impacted me hugely, and it dramatically changed my life when I picked it up, even though I didn’t know about it at the time.</p><p class="">You’re probably asking, “Jarred, what could be so enormously awesome that it would change the shape and direction of my existence here on this tiny planet called earth?!” If you’ll bear with me a few moments to tell you how I became who I am today, and how I’m still being transformed into who God calls me to be, you will walk away with a wealth of knowledge that will shift the entire playing field of life.</p><p class="">It all started on the 6th of August, 1999, when a young Coloured kid was born into a family with parents who grew up in Coronation-Ville and Westbury (two insanely dangerous areas to live in). Where I took a curve was growing up in a predominantly White neighbourhood – already I looked and felt different! My Primary School had me sitting next to all these White kids, and I quickly found myself trying to talk like them so I could fit in and discover a sense of belonging. To be honest, Grade 1-7 had me feeling like the black sheep (no pun intended, lol). Even with my tweaked accent, you wouldn’t find me chilling with the popular kids. It’s like I couldn’t find anyone who looked like me….</p><p class="">What could get worse than that? I’ll tell you exactly what – high school! Just when I had begun to somewhat fit in with the white kids, I moved on to grade eight, and to my bewilderment, everyone was Black.... boy was those years confusing! Here comes this Coloured kid, who doesn’t seem to know that he’s Coloured because he speaks like a White boy, and you can probably imagine the teasing and verbal bullying that followed! Nobody was there to prepare me for high school, and before you knew it, I started getting these weird things called hormones.</p><p class="">I guess what I’m trying to say is that I never really felt like I belonged, and because of all the adaption to my social environment that I did growing up, I never really knew who I was. This led me to have toxic friends that brought my social confidence to a low and bad relationship that made me insecure. I was searching for a sense of identity and purpose. It was probably around this time that I started drawing closer to God. In grade 10, a girl I liked invited me to her youth, and I had begun to hear about a God who loves me just the way I am. I also started attending my school’s church group (again, tbh, I didn’t have anyone to hang with), and because we knew the bible told us not to judge, I found myself in an environment where people didn’t laugh at me for being different. As I started learning about who God was and what he did for me, I started learning about who I truly was! I found confidence and joy, and my insecurities were slowly but surely passing away!</p><p class="">The bible says we were made in God’s image (Gen 1:26, 27), meaning who and what we are, <strong><em>is a reflection of who and what God is</em></strong>. You can study a reflection all you want – its shape, size and colours – but you will never truly understand what the reflection is unless you realise that is reflecting something, and what exactly it is a reflection of. Who and what we are will never be known unless we understand who and what God is! The first step on a journey of self-realisation, and self-understanding, is God’s realisation and understanding. In simple terms, I realised who I was and what I am because I came to understand who’s image I reflected and who he is!&nbsp;</p><p class="">One of the main themes of the gospel is that when Adam and Eve sinned, the image of God shattered. Our broken humanity reflects God poorly, in everything we do and in every area of our lives. A reflection cannot fix itself, and we too can’t fix ourselves. How do we get ourselves out of this mess? How do we fix the cracks in our reflections?</p><p class="">The answer lies in Jesus. Colossians 1:15 says, “He [Jesus] is the image [reflection] of the invisible God…” Jesus, in his perfect humanity, perfectly reflected God and who God is. You see, the message of the gospel is that Jesus exchanged his perfect reflection for our brokenness and “shattered-ness”, and died with all our sins and dysfunctions. When he rose to life on the third day, he left all our broken stuff in the grave and gave us his wholeness and righteousness, so that when we confess Him as Lord and believe in him and his work at the cross, his wholeness and righteousness is given to us.</p><p class="">I’m beginning to see that the reason I couldn’t find a sense of self-worth back in school, was because I was trying to be like the other shattered reflections around me. Our true identity lies in who Jesus is – his perfect reflection and wholeness. In Matthew 16:15, Jesus asks his disciples, “But who do you say I am…” Peter replies that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. Notice clearly what Jesus says afterwards – “Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church…” Pastor Steven Furtick says that once Peter knew Jesus’ identity, Jesus revealed Peter’s identity – and I strongly feel that once we embark on a journey of discovering who Jesus is, we will only then discover who we are.</p><p class="">And this is what I’m going to leave with you. I found identity and belonging, who and what I am when I found that I am a reflection of who and what God is. Although I might have been a shattered image, Jesus, in His perfection, fixed me up by taking my brokenness. Don’t try and find identity by your situations, or who may be around you at this moment and in the time to come. Insecurities and low self-esteem arise when we try and be people that we are not. Instead, pursue Jesus who and what he is, and what he has done for you. When you do so, you’ll slowly but surely begin to see who and what you are, as well as where you belong and where you’ll be.&nbsp; After all, we pursue him because he has already pursued us…. </p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">blessings, </p><p class=""> Jarred Christian Beiling</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c/1609760689126-MP5S82TZNOLBI0PCURB1/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLkXF2pIyv_F2eUT9F60jBl7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0iyqMbMesKd95J-X4EagrgU9L3Sa3U8cogeb0tjXbfawd0urKshkc5MgdBeJmALQKw/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1000"><media:title type="plain">Who do you say I am?</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>I am free.</title><dc:creator>Faith Grobler</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2019 17:05:52 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.redemptionchurch.co.za/youth-blogs/blog-post-title-three-2stw2</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c:5ff2d68b0493bd282766614e:5ff2d68b0493bd2827666153</guid><description><![CDATA[A while back, I’d been struggling with an addiction for so long, without

I used to crave it everyday and sometimes the devil brings the lie of the addiction back into my mind. I had an approval addiction…&nbsp;</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">What I mean by an ‘approval addiction’ is that I used to crave having people’s approval or feeling accepted by people. It was the end of the world if someone didn’t like me or acknowledge my existence. I would constantly worry and stress if someone likes me and when people insulted me just a little or if they were angry at me, my chest would tighten and my stomach would knot with stress until that person eventually liked me or we stopped fighting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">My world and my happiness was dependent on people liking me, if I was popular enough or if I was in everyone’s good books. I ended up being needy in the eyes of most people. I ended up having no friends and the friends I had just tolerated me and always left me out of conversations. Until something changed…&nbsp;</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">Within a few weeks, my parents got divorced and I went to stay with my dad. It was just me and him and I felt broken. I felt rejected and abandoned. I had no friends, no mom and I pushed my dad away. Life was horrible. Until one day I heard of someone who knows who I am, yet He loves me more than I could ever fully know.&nbsp;</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">I was always a Christian, but I believed God was like karma, and I believed that He was punishing me because I wasn’t good enough. I thought that, like all the other people, He thought I was not worth accepting. I went to Redemption Church and I couldn’t stop crying in the worship songs, for they were singing of a God that loved me, cared for me and wanted to be in my life. That was just the beginning, the Pastor started talking about “Grace” and that changed my life.&nbsp;</p><p class="">    </p><p class="">Grace means undeserved, unearned favour. It means that God was never karma. Yes, He is just and through being just He sent his only Son to die for all our sins that WE might be FREE. That He no longer held my bad decisions against me, but that it was forgiven.

(Romans 6:8-9) </p><p class=""> I have always heard this for as long as I can remember. People preach it, we celebrate it and I thought I knew exactly what it meant but...I never fully grasped what it meant for Christ to be risen. </p><p class=""> <em>So why is Christ’s raising so significant to me? </em></p><p class=""> Whenever I think of Christ being seated at the right-hand side of the Father in heaven (Ephesians 2:20) I think of my freedom. When Jesus rose from the dead, He publicly shamed the devil and other spiritual rulers and authorities who thought that they had victory over Him.</p><p class="">(Colossians 2:14-15). When He did this, He translated us from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light. In this new kingdom, the devil has no right torment us. So, we are free from bondage, sickness, loneliness, anxiety and so on because those things are brought from the devil to torment us. It is not God's portion for us. </p><p class="">Christ’s resurrection is proof, a receipt, that He has paid the highest price for us. We don't have to live on our own, doing everything in our own strength because that separation that was there between us and God has been removed through the blood of Jesus. We are never alone because we are in Christ and He is in us. He sent the Holy Spirit to guide and help us. </p><p class="">We have a new life because of what He did on the Cross. Our life should be full of peace (Jesus gave us a peace of mind and heart - John 14: 27), joy (as it is a fruit of the Spirit - Galatians 5:22- 23), favour, purpose, abundance, protection etc. </p><p class="">Christ died in our place. He didn't have to, but he did. Our old sinful nature was nailed on the cross with Him (Colossians 2:14) and when He rose, He rose to the highest place of authority, at God's right-hand with you and I in Him. </p><p class="">Christ has risen! This is the foundation of our faith. He defeated death for us so that we can be free. We are free, we are highly favoured, blessed, protected, loved because we are united with Christ. When God looks at us, He sees Christ - not because we work hard in our own strength to be like Him, but because the blood of Jesus has washed us clean. </p><p class="">Because He has risen, we have a life full of the promises of God.  </p><p class="">Be blessed, </p><p class="">Aza</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c/1609760379447-GJRPYFR9QL0837MB9PKC/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLkXF2pIyv_F2eUT9F60jBl7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0iyqMbMesKd95J-X4EagrgU9L3Sa3U8cogeb0tjXbfawd0urKshkc5MgdBeJmALQKw/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1000"><media:title type="plain">He is risen</media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
