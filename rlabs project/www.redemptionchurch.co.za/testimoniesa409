When asked why she thought she would die if it was extended, she said that the family would run out of money as we are not working while in lock-down. </p><p class="sqsrte-large">I told her how God fed Elijah by using ravens to bring him bread and meat and assured her that God would do the same for us. That very afternoon somebody blessed us with groceries to the extent that we could give the day and the night guards at our complex parcels of food. My daughter then told Alexis that Father God just showed her that He will take care of us because He loves us. </p><p class="sqsrte-large">She ran around the house shouting, 'Thank you, Jesus!' How great is our God! He nipped the fear that tried to grip her heart right in the but by proving His faithfulness to this precious child.

While listening to Pastor Anne on her live social media chat yesterday I was so encouraged to worship. My idea of worship is singing to our Abba, but everyone knows that I can’t sing so decided I would do what I can do and that is pray. </p><p class="sqsrte-large">I put on my playlist and started to listen to different worship song’s, Lauren Daigle , Hillsong, Bethel. I tried all my favorites: ‘you make me brave’; ‘raise a hallelujah’; ‘good good Father’ but just felt like I could not connect. I then went to my videos and listened to some of the bits I record in our services. I then put on Overcome and repeated that for about 10 times. I went and listened to the worship set for Sunday and kept on rewinding and repeating.</p><p class="sqsrte-large">I listened to our Redemption CD. I spent about 3 hrs just praying under the anointing of your music. I want to say this today: You CAN sing and maybe sometimes it’s just part of the job BUT for us people out here it is much much more than that. I know that when our band stands up that Gods anointing is pouring through you over us. I am so grateful for our worship team for saying Yes to Jesus and being available to minister to so many folks out here. </p><p class="sqsrte-large">On the 7th April I prayed for new songs straight from the throne room of Grace to be released through you and I believer it now more than ever. Thank you, thank you thank you - we so appreciate you all.</p><p class="sqsrte-large">  </p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c/1587591941047-M56IATGUKW0HLV7THAB1/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLkXF2pIyv_F2eUT9F60jBl7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0iyqMbMesKd95J-X4EagrgU9L3Sa3U8cogeb0tjXbfawd0urKshkc5MgdBeJmALQKw/greg-weaver-YY-ekIBjC0c-unsplash.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1000"><media:title type="plain">Redemption Worship</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Healed of panic attacks</title><dc:creator>Faith Grobler</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2019 17:15:07 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.redemptionchurch.co.za/testimonies/panic-attacks</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e7239232f1ecd14b3d5416c:5ea021b9b0dc2603ac6a532f:5ea021b9b0dc2603ac6a5336</guid><description><![CDATA[I have been suffering from panic attacks and since this lock-down, it has
